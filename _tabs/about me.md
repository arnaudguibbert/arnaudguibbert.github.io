## 📝 Bio

Efficient and autonomous, I am a Data Scientist with over 2+ years of experience in developing deep learning models and building end to end ML/Data Pipelines. Over the past two years, I have contributed to 4+ projects, three of which have been successfully deployed in production at Swisscom, serving over 15k+ employees.

My academic journey began outside Marseille with a Preparatory Class for the ‘grandes écoles’ at [Lycée du Parc](https://lyceeduparc.fr/ldp/) in Lyon, where I rigorously studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, and applied mechanics. After two intense years, I joined [CentraleSupélec Paris-Saclay University](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) in Paris. There, I focused on statistics, optimization, quantum physics, and fluid mechanics, earning my Bachelor's degree in Science. I then pursued a dual degree with [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Switzerland, focusing on deep learning, statistics, and optimization. In April 2023, I graduated with Master's degrees in Science from both EPFL and CentraleSupélec.

Alongside my studies, I was intern at [Procsim](https://procsim.ch/en/), where I developed meta-heuristic algorithms to optimize operating room schedules in hospitals. I also actively participated in various student associations, such as [SBCS](https://www.sbcs-events.fr/) and [CS Design](https://www.facebook.com/centralesupelecdesign/).

In September 2022, I joined [Swisscom](https://www.swisscom.ch/en/about/innovation/analytics-artificial-intelligence.html) for my master's thesis, and in June 2023, I transitioned into a Data Scientist - ML engineer role within the *Data Analytics & AI* department.

After two years at Swisscom, I embarked on a new chapter as an MLOps Engineer at [Moonpig](https://www.moonpig.com/uk/about-us/). In this role, I focus on streamlining the Data Science team's workflows by automating machine learning jobs and deployment pipelines.
